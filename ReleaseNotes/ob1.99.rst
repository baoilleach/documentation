Open Babel 1.99
===============

Released on 2002-1-29.

The Open Babel team is pleased to announce the release of Open Babel 1.99, a first beta release for the 2.0 version of the free, open-source replacement for the Babel chemistry file translation program.

At the moment, the beta release is not a drop-in replacement for babel as some file formats are not implemented and bond orders are not calculated for QM file formats.

Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source chemistry software.
