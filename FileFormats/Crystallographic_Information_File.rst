Crystallographic Information File (cif)
=======================================

**The CIF file format is the standard interchange format for small-molecule crystal structures**


Fractional coordinates are converted to cartesian ones using the following convention:

- The x axis is parallel to a
- The y axis is in the (a,b) plane
- The z axis is along c*

  (the matrix used is the 2nd form listed)
